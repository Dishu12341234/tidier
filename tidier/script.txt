*Lights dim, and a spotlight reveals four students - Divyansh, Fatema, Soumil, and Sukhmani - standing center stage with a table set up as their project display.*

---

**DIVYANSH**
Welcome, everyone! Today, we present to you our project, "Economical Waste Management System Using IoT," under the theme "LIFE - Lifestyle for Environment."

---

**FATEMA**
(Excited)
We invite you to join us on this journey towards a cleaner and greener future.

*They proceed to explain each section of their project report with enthusiasm.*

---

**SOUMIL**
(Animated)
In the bustling city of Indore, where waste management became a success story, we identified a common challenge faced by compact cities - the financial burden of waste disposal.

---

**SUKHMANI**
(Captivating)
Centralized garbage collection has its pitfalls - transportation costs, traffic congestion, and inequitable service distribution.

---

*They transition to the proposed solution, each student taking turns to share their part.*

---

**DIVYANSH**
(Confident)
Our solution? A decentralized waste management system! Picture this - smart bins with IoT sensors across the city, optimizing waste collection routes in real-time.

---

**FATEMA**
(Intriguing)
And to engage the community, we introduce a web app. Citizens can track waste collection schedules, report issues, and be an active part of the solution.

---

**SOUMIL**
(Enthusiastic)
Cost-effective IoT technology is our secret weapon. By decentralizing waste processing units, we make it not just efficient but economical.

---

**SUKHMANI**
(Inspirational)
But it's not just about technology. It's about people. Our project encourages public awareness and participation, making waste management a community effort.

**Divyansh Let's quicly see how the eletronics work**

The "Smart Dustbin with Ultrasonic Sensor and SAAS Integration" utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure garbage levels in real-time. This data is processed by an Arduino UNO microcontroller, displayed on an LED screen, and transmitted to a SAAS platform on the cloud. The SAAS platform analyzes the data, triggers alerts, and offers centralized monitoring for waste management authorities. The system promotes efficient waste collection, prevents overflow, and enables data-driven decision-making, making it a scalable and advanced solution for urban environments.
